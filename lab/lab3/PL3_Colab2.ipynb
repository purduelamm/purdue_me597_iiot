When you connect to a public network, such as accessing Google servers from your device, you are entering a shared space accessible to many users. On the other hand, connecting to a private network often involves additional steps, such as configuring IP addresses or adjusting firewall settings, to ensure secure and proper communication.\n","\n","To illustrate this with a real-world example, imagine you are setting up a router in your home and you want to connect a new security camera. If you can access your router's IP address through a VPN service, you can reach the router using a designated IP address. However, simply reaching your router does not guarantee access to your internal network devices, like your security camera.\n","\n","To address this issue, you can use a technique called Port Forwarding, which allows you to connect to internal devices from an external network. This way, you can view the security camera footage even when you're not directly connected to your home network.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/purduelamm/purdue_me597_iiot/blob/main/lab/img_F24_update/prelab3_fig3.png?raw=true\" width=\"70%\">\n","\n","*Figure 3 Port forwarding configuration*\n","<br/>\n","**Image source from AITA**\n","<br/>\n","<br/>\n","Starting from Lab 3, you will be working with several devices on a private network under the Purdue ECN (Engineering Computer Network). Similar to the home security camera example, you will encounter challenges accessing internal devices. To overcome this, you will also use Port Forwarding to facilitate these connections.\n","\n","Port-forwarding is primarily used when we need external access to services or devices within a private network. To set up port-forwarding, you must define the internal port, the external port, and the local IP address of the device you wish to connect to.\n","\n","It's important to note that the internal and external ports do not need to match each other, as the destination of the service is already known. Each port is designated for a specific service, with some ports predefined for common services. For example, port 22 is used for SSH (Secure Shell) service, and port 5900 is used for VNC (Virtual Network Computing) service.\n","\n","By configuring port-forwarding correctly, you can securely and efficiently access your private network devices from an external network, ensuring that each service is accessible through its designated port."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.4 Understand default port numbers and designated ports in IIoT class"],"metadata":{"id":"dxNM1TRg8DxT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A port refers to a \"logical connection point\" and is used by a client program to specify a particular server program on a network when using the TCP/IP internet protocol. Each port is designated for a specific service, allowing multiple services to run on a single IP address without conflict.\n","\n","When communicating over a network, access to the computer where the server is located is determined based on the IP address. If multiple applications are running on one IP, the computer will have multiple servers running. In this case, the port number must be used to indicate which server for a specific service on the target IP device should be connected to.
